   * Main driver for the compress kernel.
   * This kernel is part of a more complex algorithm
   * and is called from within a task that is executed
   * by a single thread, with multiple threads executing
   * similar or different tasks concurrently.
   * Thus, when executed on the host, the code in
   * kernels.cu will be executed by a single thread.
   * When we use CUDA/HIP, the kernel code is submitted
   * to the device as part of the task and the task
   * is suspended until completion of the kernel.
   * On the device we use both block and grid-level
   * parallelism.
   *
   * The driver here does not reflect any of the
   * task-based execution and is merely there to
   * be able to run the code and compile into a binary.
